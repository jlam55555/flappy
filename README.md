#### Description
Originally intended to be a Mario game, I quickly realized that I had no idea how Mario worked and turned around to be Flappy-- a simpler version of Flappy Bird. I played around with HTML canvas and animations using JavaScript.

Also an "extras" project under my blog, [TheHomeworkLife](http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf) ([GitHub](https://github.com/jlam55555/the-homework-life)).

#### Features
- Full gameplay
    - Animated start screen
	- Working game
	- End screen with scores
	- Ability to restart on death
- Graphics solely with JavaScript (canvas)
- Similar, recognizable gameplay from the original
- Responsive and fast, with working collision detection
